# Bootstrap_WebDesign_Animations
This is a modified Bootstrap lay out created by https://startbootstrap.com/ that I tweaked for three pages showing animations I created with Adobe Animate. I also added media queries to adjust screen to smaller devices. The "Contact" page does not use Bootstrap. This was simply created to show a simple text animation done with JS and CSS.
